# Algorithm

`Abstract`
> That's from Wikipedia


Algorithm, in mathematics and computer science, is a series of well-defined specific calculation steps, which are commonly used in calculation, 
data processing and automatic reasoning. As an effective method, the algorithm is used to calculate functions. 
It contains a series of well-defined instructions, which can be clearly expressed in limited time and space.
The instruction in the algorithm describes a calculation. When it is running, it can start from an initial state and initial input (possibly empty), 
and then through a series of limited and clearly defined states, it produces output and stops in a final state. 
The transition from one state to another is not necessarily deterministic. Some algorithms, including randomization algorithm, contain some random inputs
