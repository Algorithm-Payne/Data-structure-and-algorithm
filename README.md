# Data-structure-and-algorithm

Generally, software development involves learning new technologies on a daily basis. You get to learn most of these technologies while using them in one of your projects. However, it is not the case with algorithms.

If you don't know algorithms well, you won't be able to identify if you can optimize the code you are writing right now. You are expected to know them in advance and apply them wherever possible and critical.

I even suggest learning data structure first
Because the data structure is the front end of the algorithm and the foundation of each programming language. There is a smooth transition all the way down
